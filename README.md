he retention rate for each scenario were used as target variable to test four different prediction models (linear regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and KNN) as an attempt to predict the retention rate. The predictors were the ratio between the reed belt perimeter and estuary perimeter (in Kilometers), average wind direction, and velocity in the simulation period. The ratio was calculated by creating a polyline and calculating its perimeter using the Calculate geometry tool in ArcGIS Pro 3.3. The best model based on Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R2 was used to predict the retention rate at Oder Lagoon, a lagoon also in the Baltic (53.8183° N, 14.1328° E).
